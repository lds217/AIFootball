# AIFootball
In this project I learned:

+ Basic of Python (i hate dict)
+ YOLO: AI object detection model
+ Kmeans: Pixel segmentation and clustering to detect t-shirt color
+ Optical Flow: Measure camera movement
+ Perspective Transformation: Represent scene depth and perspective
+ Speed and distance calculation per player
+ Google Colab: train my model

This project is based on this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBZ6huolkg&t=15039s&ab_channel=CodeInaJiffy) with a few optimizations and modifications to fit my liking
